# Peer-connect
A web based platform to connect with like minded people for sharing each other's knowledge.

# Peer-connect Project Development Process

This document outlines the steps I am following to successfully develop and deploy the **Peer-connect** platform.

## 1. UI/UX Design
   - **Wireframing & Mockups:** Create initial wireframes to visualize the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) using Figma.
   - **Prototyping:** Develop an interactive prototype to map user flows and interactions.
   - **Design Review:** Ensure the design is user-friendly, intuitive, and aligns with the project goals.

## 2. Development
   - **Backend Development:** Set up the server, database, and API (using Django,).
   - **Frontend Development:** Build the user-facing components (using FLutter).
   - **Integrate Features:** Implement core features based on the design, such as:
     - User registration
     - Profile management
     - Messaging system
     - Knowledge sharing platform
     - Meeting rooms

## 3. Testing
   - **Unit Testing:** Write and run tests for individual components and functions to ensure reliability.
   - **Integration Testing:** Test interactions between backend and frontend components to ensure smooth workflows.
   - **User Testing:** Conduct usability testing to ensure the platform is user-friendly and performs as expected.

## 4. Deployment
   - **Deployment Preparation:** Optimize the platform for production.
   - **Deployment to Production:** Deploy the platform to a cloud server or hosting service (AWS).
   - **Monitoring & Maintenance:** Set up monitoring tools to track performance, user activity, and potential errors.
